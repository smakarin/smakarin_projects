| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| [Data analytics project](https://github.com/smakarin/yandex_praktikum_projects/tree/master/Quarterly%20project%20%231) | Video game sales analysis | This project involves comprehensive analysis of video game sales across different genres and platforms. The goal is to unearth underlying patterns that can help predict next year's top sellers. Results are visualized using detailed graphs for better understanding. | seaborn, plotly, scipy, seaborn | 
| [Bootstrap](https://github.com/smakarin/yandex_praktikum_projects/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20for%20Business) | Analysis of profits and risks of oil production in the region | The objective is to choose the most profitable region for oil production based on available data regarding approximate oil reserves and the condition of fields provided by the exploration team. | pandas, seaborn, bootstrap | 
| [Content of precious metals prediction](https://github.com/smakarin/yandex_praktikum_projects/tree/master/Quarterly%20project%20%232) | Modeling the process of enrichment of gold ore | The project involves building a predictive model that estimates the content of precious metals and slag at various stages of enrichment. This would help optimize the enrichment process. | sklearn, pandas, creating new metrics | 
| [Car price prediction](https://github.com/smakarin/yandex_praktikum_projects/tree/master/Gradient%20Boosting) | Determining the price of a car for online sale | This project involves building an efficient Gradient Boosting model to accurately predict the price of a car for online sale. The model aims to balance both accuracy and computational speed. | pandas, sklearn, LigtGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost |  
| [Time Series](https://github.com/smakarin/yandex_praktikum_projects/tree/master/Time%20Series) | Forecasting the number of taxi orders at a certain hour | This project involves analysis of historical taxi orders over a period of 6 months. A predictive model is developed to estimate the number of orders per hour on any given day, which helps optimize the number of drivers required. | statsmodels, sklearn, pandas, CatBoost, LightGBM |  
| [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/smakarin/yandex_praktikum_projects/tree/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing) | Determining the sentiment of comment | This project aims at building an automated system capable of recognizing toxic comments in an online store. This would help in maintaining a positive environment for users. | nltk, spacy, BERT, pandas, sklearn | 
| [Churn prediction](https://github.com/smakarin/yandex_praktikum_projects/tree/master/FINAL%20project) | Churn prediction for telecom company | This project entails constructing a classification model that can predict which customers are likely to churn. Such predictions can help companies devise retention strategies. | pandas, sklearn, LigtGBM, CatBoost |
